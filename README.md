Hello! I'm Aaliyah Young, a passionate student at ASU with a 3.67 GPA. I specialize in web development, focusing on creating engaging, user-friendly websites. I enjoy designing with a creative touch, making sure every project is both functional and visually appealing. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, or relaxing with a good book. I'm always eager to learn and grow in the tech field!
