# Hi ![GIF1](https://i.imgur.com/iWbQVpV.gif) I'm Aaliyah Young ![Aaliyah's GIF](https://i.imgur.com/sfxstqI.gif)

I'm an aspiring front-end developer! Im 21 and currently a senior of ASU, I'm still a little clueless of what to do for the future but hopefully I land a job as a web developer! I've been learning to code HTML since in middle school and high school using a website called "toyhouse" (since you needed to pay a premium to use CSS) it wasnt until I enrolled in college I started to learn how to code in CSS as well!
